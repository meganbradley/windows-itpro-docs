# Diagnostic Data Viewer for PowerShell overview

**Applies to**

- Windows 11, version 21H2 and later
- Windows 10, version 1803 and later
- Windows Server, version 1803
- Windows Server 2019

The Diagnostic Data Viewer for PowerShell is a PowerShell module that lets you review the diagnostic data your device is sending to Microsoft, grouping the info into simple categories based on how it's used by Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have administrative privilege on the device in order to use this PowerShell module.

## Install the Diagnostic Data Viewer for PowerShell

You must install the module before you can use the Diagnostic Data Viewer for PowerShell.

### Open an elevated PowerShell session

Using the Diagnostic Data Viewer for PowerShell requires administrative (elevated) privilege. There are two ways to open an elevated PowerShell prompt. You can use either method.
- Go to **Start** > **Windows PowerShell** > **Run as administrator**
- Go to **Start** > **Command prompt** > **Run as administrator**, and run the command `C:\> powershell.exe`

### Install the Diagnostic Data Viewer for PowerShell

>[!TIP]
>For more information on installing a PowerShell module, see [Getting Started with the PowerShell Galley](/powershell/gallery/getting-started).

To install the newest version of the Diagnostic Data Viewer PowerShell module, run the following command within an elevated PowerShell session:
```powershell
PS C:\> Install-Module -Name Microsoft.DiagnosticDataViewer
```

For more information about the module, go to the [Microsoft.DiagnosticDataViewer](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.DiagnosticDataViewer) page in the PowerShell Gallery.

### Turn on data viewing

Before you can use this tool, you must turn on data viewing. Turning on data viewing enables Windows to store a local history of your device's diagnostic data for you to view until you turn it off.

This setting doesn't control whether your device sends diagnostic data. Instead, it controls whether your Windows device saves a local copy of the diagnostic data sent for your viewing.

Once data viewing is enabled, your device begins saving a history of diagnostic data that is sent to Microsoft from this point on.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Turning on data viewing can use up to 1 GB (default setting) of disk space on your system drive. We recommend that you turn off data viewing when you're done using the Diagnostic Data Viewer. For info about turning off data viewing, see the [Turn off data viewing](#turn-off-data-viewing) section later in this article.

#### To turn on data viewing through the Settings page

1. Go to **Start**, select **Settings** > **Privacy & security** > **Diagnostics & feedback**.

2. Under **View diagnostic data**, turn on the **Turn on the Diagnostic Data Viewer** option.

#### To turn on data viewing through PowerShell

Run the following command within an elevated PowerShell session:  

```powershell
PS C:\> Enable-DiagnosticDataViewing
```

## Get started with using the Diagnostic Data Viewer for PowerShell

To see how to use the cmdlet, the parameters it accepts, and examples, run the following command from an elevated PowerShell session:

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-Help Get-DiagnosticData
```

To start viewing Diagnostic Data, from an elevated PowerShell session, run the following command:

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DiagnosticData
```

If the number of events is large, and you'd like to stop the command, enter `Ctrl+C`.

>[!NOTE]
>The preceding command might produce little to no results if you enabled data viewing recently. It can take several minutes before your Windows device can show diagnostic data it sent.

## Working with the Diagnostic Data Viewer for PowerShell

The Diagnostic Data Viewer for PowerShell provides you with the following features to view and filter your device's diagnostic data. You can also use the extensive suite of other PowerShell tools with this module.

> [!TIP]
> For more information about the PowerShell commands available, see the [Microsoft.DiagnosticDataViewer module documentation](/powershell/module/microsoft.diagnosticdataviewer).

### View your diagnostic events

Running `PS C:\> Get-DiagnosticData`, you can review your diagnostic events. These events reflect activities that occurred and were sent to Microsoft.

Each event is displayed as a PowerShell Object. By default each event shows the event name, the time when it was seen by your Windows device, whether the event is [Required](configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization.md#required-diagnostic-data), its diagnostic event category, and a detailed JSON view of the information it contains, which shows the event exactly as it was when sent to Microsoft. Microsoft uses this info to continually improve the Windows operating system.

### View diagnostic event categories

Each event shows the diagnostic event categories that it belongs to. These categories define how events are used by Microsoft. The categories are shown as numeric identifiers.

To view the diagnostic category represented by each numeric identifier and what the category means, you can run the following command:

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DiagnosticDataTypes
```  

### Filter events by when they were sent

You can view events within specified time ranges by specifying a start time and end time of each command. For example, to see all diagnostic data sent between 12 and 6 hours ago, run the following command. Data is shown in order of oldest first.

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DiagnosticData -StartTime (Get-Date).AddHours(-12) -EndTime (Get-Date).AddHours(-6)
```

### Export the results of each command

You can export the results of each command to a separate file such as a csv by using pipe `|`. For example:

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DiagnosticData | Export-Csv 'mydata.csv'
```

## Turn off data viewing

When you're done reviewing your diagnostic data, we recommend turning off data viewing to prevent using up more memory. Turning off data viewing stops Windows from saving a history of your diagnostic data and clears the existing history of diagnostic data from your device.

### To turn off data viewing through the Settings page

1. Go to **Start**, select **Settings** > **Privacy & security** > **Diagnostics & feedback**.

2. Under **View diagnostic data**, turn off the **If data viewing is enabled, you can see your diagnostics data** option.


### To turn off data viewing through PowerShell

Within an elevated PowerShell session, run the following command:  

```powershell
PS C:\> Disable-DiagnosticDataViewing
```

## Modifying the size of your data history

By default, the tool shows you up to 1 GB or 30 days of data (whichever comes first). Once either the time or space limit is reached, the data is incrementally dropped with the oldest data points dropped first.

### Modify the size of your data history

>[!IMPORTANT]
>- Modifying the maximum amount of diagnostic data viewable by the tool might come with performance impacts to your machine.
>- If you modify the maximum data history size from a larger value to a lower value, you must turn off data viewing and turn it back on in order to reclaim disk space.

You can change the maximum data history size (in megabytes) that you can view. For example, to set the maximum data history size to 2,048 MB (2 GB), you can run the following command.

```powershell
PS C:\> Set-DiagnosticStoreCapacity -Size 2048
```

You can change the maximum data history time (in hours) that you can view. For example, to set the maximum data history time to 24 hours, you can run the following command.

```powershell
PS C:\> Set-DiagnosticStoreCapacity -Time 24
```

>[!NOTE]
>- You might need to restart your machine for the new settings to take effect.
>- If you have the [Diagnostic Data Viewer](diagnostic-data-viewer-overview.md) store app installed on the same device, modifications to the size of your data history through the PowerShell module will also be reflected in the app.  

### Reset the size of your data history

To reset the maximum data history size back to its original 1 GB default value, run the following command in an elevated PowerShell session:

```powershell
PS C:\> Set-DiagnosticStoreCapacity -Size 1024 -Time 720 
```

When resetting the size of your data history to a lower value, be sure to turn off data viewing and turn it back on in order to reclaim disk space.
